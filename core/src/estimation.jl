# estimation.jl — generic least-squares / Gauss-Newton scaffold + the bearings-only
# position fix (HANDOFF §9, slice 5 gate 1).
#
# Two layers, kept apart on purpose:
#   • A MEASUREMENT-AGNOSTIC scaffold — `linear_ls(A, b, W)` (the weighted 2×2
#     normal-equation solve) and `gauss_newton(p0, residual_fn, jacobian_fn, R;
#     iters)` (callback-based) — that GPS trilateration (slice 6) and the seeker
#     filter reuse with their OWN residual/Jacobian. The 2×2 inverse is closed-form
#     and dependency-free (the `_range` no-LinearAlgebra house style); GPS's 4
#     unknowns later swap only the inner inverse, not these signatures (advisor §9).
#   • `bearings_fix` — the ONE bearings-specific resident here (the staged gate needs
#     it at gate 1, before geolocation.jl exists; gate 2's `Geolocator` just calls it).
#     It builds the `[sin θ̂, −cos θ̂]` rows / the wrapped residual and calls the scaffold.
#
# Pure / no `w.rng` (the fix is closed-form for `:pseudolinear`, a fixed-iteration
# solve for `:ml`), so — like slices 2 and 4 — there is NO draw-topology hazard: the
# `:estimator` rung selects only post-processing, never a draw. 2-D azimuth-only.

# The estimator-fidelity rungs (slice 5). The SINGLE source of truth: `bearings_fix`
# validates against this, and gate-2's `LIVE_FIDELITY_MODES` will REFERENCE it (the
# `CFAR_MODES` one-list-no-drift lesson). Defined HERE (estimation.jl is included
# before radar.jl) so that reference needs no include-order gymnastics (advisor #5).
#   • :pseudolinear — closed-form, the BIASED baseline (noisy θ̂ sits in the regressor).
#   • :ml           — iterated Gauss-Newton seeded at pseudolinear, removes most bias.
const ESTIMATOR_MODES = (:pseudolinear, :ml)

# The seeker-fidelity rungs (slice 11) — the SINGLE source of truth for the `:seeker` key,
# defined HERE (estimation.jl precedes radar.jl) so gate-2's `LIVE_FIDELITY_MODES` REFERENCES
# it (the `ESTIMATOR_MODES`/`GUIDANCE_MODES` "mode-const-before-radar, one-list-no-drift"
# precedent) and `set_fidelity` picks it up with no server change.
#
# A GENUINELY NEW FIDELITY-CLASS COMBINATION — name it precisely, copy NEITHER template
# (advisor / gate-0 FINDINGS):
#   • DRAW-INVARIANT (class 4a, the slice-5 `:estimator` shape): BOTH rungs draw the SAME
#     one `randn(w.rng)` seeker sample every tick; the filter is pure post-processing → the
#     rung is INTRODUCIBLE via `set_fidelity` (UNLIKE `:cfar`, which flips draw topology), and
#     a `:raw↔:filtered` toggle never desyncs the RNG stream.
#   • YET TRAJECTORY-CHANGING (the slice-10 `:guidance` shape): the toggle selects WHICH `ω`
#     PN consumes (`:raw` → naïve finite-difference `λ̇`, `:filtered` → the α-β estimate), so it
#     MOVES the missile — NOT bit-identical (do NOT copy the slice-5 "toggle-bit-identical"
#     language), and NOT a dead knob.
# This is also the FIRST `w.rng` consumer in the missile arc: the slice-8/9/10 "RNG-is-vacuous"
# boilerplate INVERTS here — conventions 3 (unconditional draw) and 11 (own Xoshiro for MC)
# now APPLY. Byte-identity for slices 1–10 comes from the Seeker NOT EXISTING there, NOT from a
# draw-skipping `:truth` rung (there is none; "truth-fed PN" IS slice 10 — no Seeker).
#   • :raw      — the naïve foil: finite-difference consecutive noisy LOS angles
#     (`λ̇_raw = wrap(λ_meas − λ_prev)/dt`), amplifying the angle noise by `1/dt`.
#     PN's `N·Vc·λ̇_raw` then carries thousands of m/s² of noise → `a_max` pegs, the miss opens.
#   • :filtered — the α-β tracker (`alpha_beta_los_step`) estimates `λ̇` by predict–correct
#     WITHOUT differentiating → a smooth rate, PN leads to a tight intercept, saturation off.
#   • :scan     — slice-13 countermeasures: instead of ONE noisy truth bearing, the seeker forms
#     a NOISY angular-power PROFILE over a fixed `N_bins` grid (K lobes painted by
#     `paint_angular_profile!`, then the `2·N_p·N_bins` `randn` floor from `_draw_profile!`),
#     CFAR-DETECTS the peaks (`cfar_scan`, the slice-3 sandbox on the ANGLE axis), and resolves
#     the tracked bearing by `discrimination` (`:none` blend-all vs `:gated` α-β-gated). It is a
#     GENUINELY DIFFERENT CLASS from :raw/:filtered — a DRAW-TOPOLOGY FLIP (class 4b, the `:cfar`
#     shape): `1` randn/tick (:raw/:filtered) → `2·N_p·N_bins`/tick, so `set_fidelity` must REJECT
#     INTRODUCING or REMOVING it (gate 2, the cfar precedent) while `:raw↔:filtered` stay
#     introduce-safe — `SEEKER_MODES` gains MIXED introduce-safety. The measurement NOISE moved
#     into the profile floor (the `2·N_p·N_bins` draws), so `:scan` draws EXACTLY that (no +1
#     output `randn`) and the slice-11 `sigma_seek` slider goes INERT under it (documented, gate 2).
const SEEKER_MODES = (:raw, :filtered, :scan)

# fidelity: DRAW-INVARIANT among its rungs (both build the SAME profile / SAME `2·N_p·N_bins`
# draws — they differ ONLY in post-detection peak SELECTION, zero extra draws → introduce-safe once
# `:scan` is on) YET TRAJECTORY-CHANGING (the toggle MOVES the missile — not a dead knob), and
# INERT unless `seeker=:scan` (no profile → no peaks → the key does nothing; the `:raim`-without-GPS
# coupling). NOT the free-standing class-4a of slice-11 `:seeker` — it is "draw-invariant within a
# 4b host" (the copy-paste false-claim trap, convention 4c).
#   • :none  — the intensity-weighted centroid of ALL detected peaks (`intensity_centroid`) → the
#     brighter/separating decoy lobe drags the blend OFF the target → the seeker is SEDUCED.
#   • :gated — the nearest-neighbor peak to the α-β PREDICTED bearing within a gate half-width
#     (`validation_gate`; coast on the prediction if none is in-gate) → the RGPO track-gate rejects
#     the separated decoy lobe → the seeker HOLDS the true target. CFAR alone cannot reject a

from `length(p0)` — 2 for the DF bearings fix, 4 for the GPS trilateration fix, the
§9 shared scaffold). `residual_fn(p)` returns the residual vector `r` (already wrapped

and `R` is the DIAGONAL vector of measurement variances. Each step solves
`Δ = (HᵀR⁻¹H)⁻¹ HᵀR⁻¹ r` via [`_solve_normal`](@ref), `p ← p + Δ`; the returned
`cov = (HᵀR⁻¹H)⁻¹` at the final `p`. Returns plain `Vector`/`Matrix` (dimension-generic);
the 2-D `bearings_fix` wraps them back to `SVector{2}`/`SMatrix{2,2}`.

**Fixed iteration COUNT, not until-convergence** (named approximation, HANDOFF §1):
"N-step Gauss-Newton" keeps a tick bounded and bit-reproducible — a `while !converged`
loop could spin under bad geometry and stall the tick non-deterministically.

**Divergence → seed fallback (advisor #6).** A fixed count bounds time, not the
result: a GN step under bad geometry can overshoot to a non-finite `p̂` or grow the
residual. So a step that yields a non-finite `p` OR a larger weighted residual norm is
REJECTED and the loop stops, keeping the last good `p` — and since callers seed `p0`
at a sensible guess (pseudolinear for DF, the scene origin for GPS), the worst case is
"no better than the seed," never NaN / never a spin.

Bearings-only (angle-of-arrival) position fix in the x-y plane. `thetas[i]` is the
MEASURED bearing from sensor `positions[i]` (a `Vec3`/2-vector, z ignored) with
1-σ accuracy `sigmas[i]` (radians). Returns the 2-D estimate and its linearized
covariance `(HᵀR⁻¹H)⁻¹` — the ellipse C for [`error_ellipse`](@ref).

`:pseudolinear` — each bearing is the line `sin θ̂ᵢ·(x−xᵢ) − cos θ̂ᵢ·(y−yᵢ) = 0`;
stack rows `Aᵢ = [sin θ̂ᵢ, −cos θ̂ᵢ]`, RHS `bᵢ = xᵢ sin θ̂ᵢ − yᵢ cos θ̂ᵢ`, and solve by
weighted [`linear_ls`](@ref). The closed-form BIASED baseline (named approximation,
HANDOFF §1): the noisy `θ̂` sits inside `A`, correlating the regressor with the error
— worst at long range / shallow crossings.

**Weighting (named two-pass; the watch-item that an inconsistent R̂ᵢ biases the fix):**
`Wᵢ = 1/(σᵢ²·R̂ᵢ²)` is the perpendicular-offset variance, but R̂ᵢ (sensor→emitter
range) is unknown a priori. So a first pass with σ-only weights `1/σᵢ²` gives a seed,
R̂ᵢ = ‖seed − sensorᵢ‖ is computed ONCE, and a single re-weighted solve follows (NOT
iterated to convergence — that drifts into IRLS and complicates determinism). The
SAME R̂ᵢ feeds the weights everywhere.

computes the pseudolinear solution first — deterministic, no extra draws, the rung
switch stays draw-free). Residual `rᵢ = wrap(θ̂ᵢ − atan(ŷ−yᵢ, x̂−xᵢ))`, Jacobian row
`Hᵢ = [−sin θᵢ(p)/R̂ᵢ, cos θᵢ(p)/R̂ᵢ]` (the model bearing at the current estimate; at
the fix it coincides with θ̂ᵢ to O(residual)). Removes most of the pseudolinear bias.

Intensity-weighted mean bearing of `peaks` (an iterable of `(λ, weight)` tuples), computed
WRAP-SAFELY about the strongest-weight bearing `λ_ref`:

    λ_c = wrap_angle(λ_ref + Σ wᵢ·wrap_angle(λᵢ − λ_ref) / Σ wᵢ)

Averaging WRAPPED deltas about a reference (not a naïve mean) is the ±π seam guard — a
target near +π and a decoy near −π blend to the true midpoint, NOT a jump to 0 (the slice-5
wrap trap). Choosing `λ_ref` = the strongest peak's OWN bearing makes it self-contained (no
external reference) and gives the **additivity anchor**: a SINGLE peak returns its bearing
EXACTLY (`wrap(λ−λ)=0` → `wrap(λ)=λ`, bit-exact for an already-wrapped `λ ∈ [−π, π]`).
Used BOTH within a cluster (`extract_peaks`, the peak angle) AND across peaks (the `:none`
blend). Pure / wrap-safe (`wrap_angle` only).

    extract_peaks(grid, z, detections) -> Vector{Tuple{Float64, Float64}}

Cluster CONTIGUOUS runs of `detections[i] == true` in the scanned profile `z` into peaks.
Each contiguous run `[i, j−1]` becomes one `(λ_peak, strength)`: `λ_peak` is the
`intensity_centroid` of the run's bin bearings `grid[k]` weighted by their scanned power
`z[k]` (a power-weighted, wrap-safe centroid → sub-bin angular resolution), and `strength =
Σ z[k]` over the run (the peak's total power, the centroid weight for the `:none` blend and
the association strength). Peaks are returned in grid (ascending-bin) order; NO detections
→ an EMPTY vector (the Seeker then coasts on the α-β prediction — never tracks nothing).
`grid`, `z`, `detections` share the fixed grid length. Pure.

"""
    validation_gate(peaks, λ_pred, halfwidth) -> λ::Float64   (or `nothing`)

The RGPO track-GATE / nearest-neighbor association — the discriminator (`:gated`). Returns
the bearing of the peak NEAREST the α-β predicted bearing `λ_pred`, but only if it lies
within `halfwidth` of the prediction (`|wrap_angle(λ − λ_pred)| ≤ halfwidth`); otherwise
`nothing` (COAST — the caller holds `λ_pred`, NEVER tracks a peak outside the gate). Empty
`peaks` → `nothing`.

This is what rejects a SEPARATED decoy: once the decoy lobe leaves the gate about the
target-locked prediction, the nearest IN-gate peak is the target's and the brighter decoy is
ignored. CFAR alone cannot reject a brighter decoy (a bright decoy is a strong DETECTION, not
a rejection) — the α-β predicted-LOS ASSOCIATION is the discriminator (HANDOFF §9: the seeker
walked off by a decoy IS the RGPO model; the gate is precisely what RGPO captures and drags).
Nearest-neighbor + a hard `halfwidth` reject (NOT keep-all-in-gate-then-centroid, which
re-blends the decoy and makes `:gated` worse than `:none` — gate-0 FINDINGS). Pure / wrap-safe.
