# missile.jl — the BallisticMissile subsystem: the FIRST force-based integrator in the
# tick loop (HANDOFF §3, §10 item 8, slice 8 gate 2).
#
# Slices 1–7 lit phases 2/3/4 of the tick contract repeatedly but only ever used phase 1
# (`integrate!`) for TRIVIAL kinematics — `ConstantVelocity`'s `pos += vel·dt`. The
# BallisticMissile is the first phase-1 mover that solves an actual Newtonian ODE
# (forces → accel → vel → pos) via the gate-1 steppers in `dynamics.jl`, under the shared
# `frames.jl` frame algebra. It lights NO NEW phase — its novelty is REAL dynamics where
# every prior slice had passive movers, plus the first live use of `frames.jl`
# (velocity-aligned attitude). `observe!`/`decide!` stay EMPTY here — guidance / seekers are
# slices 9–11 (do NOT add them).
#
# Included AFTER radar.jl (mirroring geolocation.jl/esm.jl/gps.jl) but with NO back-dep on
# radar's radar/jammer symbols: it reuses only `dynamics.jl` (`total_accel`,
# `integrator_step`, `INTEGRATOR_MODES`, `G_ACCEL`), `frames.jl` (`quat_from_two_vectors`),
# gnss.jl's `_norm3`, and geometry.jl's `_finite`/`_finite_coord` — all in scope before it.
#
# TELEMETRY PHASE — a NAMED deviation from the plan's phrasing (advisor-confirmed): the plan
# sketch says "phase-1 writes into env[:telemetry] like the radar readout", but `tick!` calls
# `empty!(w.env)` immediately AFTER phase 1, so a phase-1 telemetry write is wiped before the
# frame is built (and the radar readout is actually PHASE-3 observe!, post-empty!). So the
# missile's ENERGY/POSITION readout is published from `build_env!` (phase 2, post-empty!,
# reading the post-integrate state) — a DERIVED quantity, order-independent, RNG-free, and NOT
# a sensing/guidance phase (those stay empty for slices 9–11). `integrate!` owns the physics;
# `build_env!` owns the readout.
#
# DETERMINISM (advisor #1 — the one place copying the slice-5/6/7 template gives a FALSE
# claim): there is NO RNG in slice 8, so "RNG lockstep" / "draw-count-invariance" is VACUOUS,
# not a property to prove. Three distinct claims, never conflated:
#   1. INTRODUCE-SAFE — absent a `:missile` entity nothing reads `:integrator`, so introducing
#      it mid-run on any slice-1..7 scenario is a no-op → slices 1–7 byte-identical.
#   2. same-config replay is bit-identical — deterministic, TRIVIALLY (no RNG to desync).
#   3. a mid-run `:integrator` toggle CHANGES the trajectory (the not-a-dead-knob property) —
#      the OPPOSITE of slices 5/6/7's toggle invariance. `:integrator` is a PHYSICS-CHANGING
#      fidelity (the slice-2 `propagation` shape), NOT toggle-bit-identical.
#
# NAMED APPROXIMATIONS (HANDOFF §1 — the force-model ones live in dynamics.jl; the two here):
#   • within-`dt` impact clamp — the ground crossing is clamped to `z = 0` within one step, NOT
#     sub-step root-found (sub-mm at guidance rates); named, not implied.
#   • velocity-aligned attitude is KINEMATIC-ONLY — a point-mass body has no attitude dynamics
#     (no fin/actuator model — 6-DOF is deferred, §11 Tier A); `att` is set to point body-x
#     along `v` purely for the client's nose direction, never fed back into the force.

# Total mechanical energy `E = ½·m·‖v‖² + m·g·z` (KE + flat-earth PE), joules — the "lesson as
# a number" (HANDOFF §1). Drag off + `:rk4` conserves it to machine eps over the flight; drag
# on bleeds it monotonically. Shared by the e0 init and the readout.
_missile_ke(mass, vel) = 0.5 * mass * (vel[1]^2 + vel[2]^2 + vel[3]^2)
_missile_pe(mass, pos) = mass * G_ACCEL * pos[3]
_missile_energy(mass, pos, vel) = _missile_ke(mass, vel) + _missile_pe(mass, pos)

# A mass floor at the consumer so a live/degenerate config can't divide-by-zero in the drag
# term or the energy (mass is loader-validated > 0, so this is belt-and-braces, the
# `_SIGMA_RANGE_FLOOR` precedent).
const _MISSILE_MASS_FLOOR = 1.0e-9
# Below this |E₀| the fractional conservation error `ΔE = (E−E₀)/E₀` is ill-defined (a launch
# at z=0 with v→0) → report 0.0 rather than a blow-up (which `_finite` would clamp anyway).

"""
    BallisticMissile(id)

The ballistic projectile `id` as a phase-1 `integrate!`-only subsystem — the FIRST
force-based integrator in the tick loop. Each physics step it solves the airframe ODE
`(ṗ, v̇) = (v, a(v))` (with `a = total_accel`, dynamics.jl) via the gate-1 stepper selected
by the `:integrator` fidelity (`get(w.fidelity, :integrator, :rk4)`), advancing the entity's
`(pos, vel)`. It owns `pos`/`vel` advancement, so the loader gives a `:missile` entity
`[BallisticMissile]` and **NOT** `ConstantVelocity` (two phase-1 movers would double-integrate).

Airframe config lives in the entity `comp` bag, read with DEFAULTS at the consumer so a bare
`:missile` block or a live slider can't `KeyError`/crash a tick (the "a live config can't crash
a tick" watch-item): `:mass_kg`, `:cd_area_m2` (the lumped `Cd·A`; drag off = `0`), `:rho`
(air density, default `1.225`). On the ground crossing (`z ≤ 0` descending) it clamps `z = 0`,
zeroes the velocity, latches `comp[:impacted] = true` (subsequent ticks no-op — the frozen
splash), and emits ONE `:impact` event. Sets a velocity-aligned attitude each step
(`quat_from_two_vectors([1,0,0], v̂)`, exercising `frames.jl` live + its apex `v→0` guard).
