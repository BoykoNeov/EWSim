# test_airframe.jl — the pitch-plane rotational dynamics library vs its closed forms
# (HANDOFF §11 Tier A, slice 16 gate 1).
#
# Like dynamics/frames these are DETERMINISTIC, so every check is an exact closed form with
# an EXPLICIT atol (never rtol-`≈0`, which passes trivially — convention 11). The §1
# co-headline is SIGNS: the `Cmα` static-stability sign is the #1 trap, so the moment SIGN
# is pinned DIRECTLY (advisor tooth #1) — not just the oscillation frequency, which a double
# sign flip (α = θ−γ AND M-sign) would survive. V and γ are FROZEN in every closed-form test
# (advisor tooth #2 — Q = ½ρV² drifts with V, γ drifts with lift; the ω_sp/trim anchors are
# the flight-path-frozen short-period reduction). The damping test measures the log-decrement
# and pins ζ, not just ω_sp (advisor tooth #3 — a q̄ = q·d/(2V) factor-of-2 / ref-length slip
# leaves the frequency right but the damping wrong), and asserts the oscillation CENTER sits
# at α_trim (with Cmq = 0 the undamped swing must be centered on trim, not ending there).
